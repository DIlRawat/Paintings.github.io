# Paintings.github.io
Simple website to view Paintings. I tired to host the website but github let you host only static websites. 
Built a responsive website for my sister to sell her paintings. Users can view painting details, add the items to the cart, remove items from the cart. 
Got familiar with the following: 
•	Configuration of webserver software and the use of server-side programming.
•	Server-side scripting. Database access and drivers.
•	Security issues, including access control and secured transmissions.
